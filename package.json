  "description": "Workerifiy is an ES module to wrap any function or object into a Web Worker. It avoids the pain of creating a separate worker file and handling messages. One pass a function or an object to Workerify, which returns an asynchronous function. This function may be called just like the original one but will be processed in the dedicated Web Worker; it will return promises.",
